Alba.XnaConvert
===============

Command-line utility for converting XNA XNB files.

Features
--------

* Converting Texture2D XNB files to PNG images.
* All versions of XNA are supported: 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 3.1, 4.0.

N.B.
----

Do not forget: the fact that you *can technically extract* and view the resources from some games does not mean you *can legally use* the resources. Even extracting can be illegal in your country. If you are unsure, do not use this program.
